<p>When it comes to buying a new car buyers have countless options, but most cars are actually specialized for certain markets. Personally, I wanted to find a sports sedan and the Q50 stuck out. Here is some information I found about the Q50 and I hope it helps narrow down your car search.</p>
<p>The Infiniti Q50 is classified as a compact executive car and is produced by the manufacturer Infiniti. Infiniti is owned by the parent manufacturere Nissan, based in Japan. The vehicle had its debut in North America at the 2013 North American International Auto Show and went on sale in North America later that year.</p>
<p> The vehicle is available in several engine types including a 2.0L turbo, 3.5L hybrid, 3.7L, and in later years (2016-present) a 3.0L Twin Turbo. All models are based in a Front Engine, Rear Wheel Drive configuration. The Q50 is also available in a Sports model which gives the driver a stiffer, track tuned suspension, paddle shifters on the steering wheel, larger brakes, and 19" rims as apposed to the 17" tims that are standard on other models.</p>
<p> The vehicle is sold with a very elegant interior featuring heated seats and steering wheel, a dual touch screen infotainment system, leather power seats, and a premium bose sound system. Navigation is optional with this vehicle. For those seeking a fast car the Q50 does not dissapoint as the 3.7L model gets the car from 0-60 in just 5.1 seconds.</p>
<p> For the year 2017 the vehicle starts with a price tag of $33,950 for the base model and can climb to $48,700 for the 3.0t Red Sport 400 trim level. The Availble trim levels are shown in the table below.</p>
