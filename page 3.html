<p>The Q50 also has some tough competition, in the car market the vehicle competes mainly with the Lexus IS models and the BMW 3 Series. While the IS models and the 3 series remain popular vehicles, the fact that the Q50 has been the cheaper and more powerful vehicle has given it great success over the other two.<p>
<p>The following videos of the q50 compared with the 3 series and Lexus IS models. While these videos are good references one should always check the car themselves to see if they like it as these videos are ultimately opinions</p>
